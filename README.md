# Description
The Honeywell HPM Series Particle Sensor is a laser-based
sensor which uses the light scattering method to detect
and count particles in the concentration range of 0 µg/m3
to 1,000 µg/m3 in a given environment. A laser light source
illuminates a particle as it is pulled through the detection
chamber. As particles pass through the laser beam, the light
source becomes obscured and is recorded on the photo or
light detector. The light is then analyzed and converted to
an electrical signal providing particulate size and quantity to
calculate concentrations in real time. The Honeywell particle
sensor provides information on the particle concentration for
given particle concentration range
